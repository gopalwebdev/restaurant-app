/**

 * switcher for the whole form deciding which language those boxes are showing.
 *
 * A field still has an input per language underneath — that is how the state of
 * every language reaches the save in one go — but only the switched-to one is
 * on screen. A form with a name and a description used to be four boxes; it is
 * two, and the form no longer doubles in height for each language added.
 *
 * Two consequences worth knowing:
 *
 * - Hidden languages are still dehydrated, so switching to Tamil and saving
 *   keeps the English that was already typed. Without that, editing one
 *   language would quietly blank the other.
 * - Validation that has to hold whichever language is showing — English is
 *   required, English is unique — is attached to *every* language's input and
 *   reads the English value out of the form state rather than off the input it
 *   happens to be attached to. A rule left only on the English input would
 *   never run while Tamil was the one on screen, and the save would fail at the
 *   database instead.
