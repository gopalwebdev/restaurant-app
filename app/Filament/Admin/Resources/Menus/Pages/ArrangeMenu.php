/**
 * The first thing a menu opens on: everything it holds, in the order it is read.
 *
 * A menu used to be edited across four tables that each showed one layer of it,
 * and the order of the featured and combo rails could not be changed at all.
 * This page is one list of the whole menu — both rails, every category, every
 * subdivision and every dish — and one drag puts any of them somewhere else.
 *
 * The table is built on custom data because those rows are three models and two
 * rails; see MenuArrangementTable for what that costs. What it means here is
 * this page owns reordering itself: Filament's own reorderTable() writes one
 * UPDATE over an Eloquent query, and there isn't one.
