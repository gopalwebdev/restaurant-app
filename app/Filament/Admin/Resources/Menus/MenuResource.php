/**
 * The menus this restaurant serves: Lunch, Dinner, Drinks.
 *
 * The top of the hierarchy the panel edits. One menu opens on its arrangement:
 * its categories, their subdivisions, the dishes in each and the two rails it
 * leads with, all in one list and all dragged into order there. Dishes are
 * still their own page — there are far more of them, and they are the thing a
 * restaurant edits daily.
 *
 * A restaurant that serves one card all day simply keeps one menu.
 *
 * Scoping is Filament's: the panel has a tenant, so every query here is limited
 * to the restaurant in the subdomain and new rows are stamped with it. Who may
 * use the page is MenuPolicy's business, through menu.view and menu.manage.
