 * that had run out of prawns and one that had stopped serving biryani after
 * three o'clock looked identical on the menu — and both looked like the dish
 * had been taken off. The reason is worth carrying: a guest reads "sold out"
 * differently from "not available right now", and the kitchen reads the two
 * differently when putting the menu back.
 *
 * Nothing is ever hard-deleted to take it off the menu. That is what these
 * cases are for, and what the delete warnings in the panel say.
