 * The two things on a menu that are not a category.

 * A menu is read as a sequence of blocks: the dishes it leads with, the combos
 * it sells together, and its categories. The categories carry their own
 * `position`; these two carry theirs on the menu itself, in the same number
 * space, so all three can be dragged into one order on the arrangement screen.
 *
 * `positionColumn()` is the single place that says which column belongs to
 * which rail — the same shape as HomeTileAction::targetColumn(). Adding a third
 * rail means a case, a column and a line there, and nothing else.
