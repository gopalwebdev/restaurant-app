 * and every translated column stores one key per case. Adding a language is a
 * case and nothing else.
 *
 * What is translated is what a **restaurant wrote** — menu, category, dish,
 * addition and tile names, all of them database columns. What this application
 * writes is English and stays English: `lang/en` is the only directory in
 * `lang/`, so switching language changes the menu a guest reads without
 * changing the words around it. A `lang/ta` existed and was deliberately
 * deleted; do not reintroduce a second copy of the chrome.
 *
 * English is the default and the fallback, which is also why it is the locale
 * the database's unique indexes are built on — see App\Models\Concerns\HasTranslatedNames.
