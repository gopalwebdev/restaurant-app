/**
 * The product team's panel, served at restaurant-app.com/dashboard and entered
 * through restaurant-app.com/login.
 *
 * It is bound to the bare host so it can never be reached from a tenant
 * subdomain, and it is the default panel because it carries no tenancy. It
 * shares /dashboard with every restaurant's panel and is told apart by host,
 * which holds because this provider is registered first (bootstrap/providers.php).
