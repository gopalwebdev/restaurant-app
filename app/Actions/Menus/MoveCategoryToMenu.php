/**
 * Move a category, and everything in it, onto another of the same
 * restaurant's menus.
 *
 * A restaurant that splits one card into a lunch and a dinner menu wants to
 * carry a whole section across rather than retype it. Its subdivisions follow
 * by the ON UPDATE CASCADE on the (parent_id, menu_id) key, and the dishes
 * follow because they hang off a category rather than off a menu.
 *
 * This is the only way a subdivision ever changes menus: its parent moves, and
 * it follows.
 *
 * Two guards, both backstops: MenuArrangementTable states the same rules as
 * validation, so the panel never reaches these. The target menu has to belong
 * to the same restaurant — the composite foreign key would refuse otherwise,
 * but only as a 500 — and the name has to be free on the target, because
 * uniqueness is per menu and the expression index would reject the update
 * after the form had already passed.
