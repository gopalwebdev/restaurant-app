/**
 * Put a menu in the order an admin has just dragged it into.
 *
 * The arrangement screen is one flat table holding four kinds of row — the
 * featured rail, the combos rail, the categories at both levels, and the dishes
 * in each — so a drag arrives as one flat list of keys covering the whole menu.
 * This turns that back into the four kinds of `position` the menu actually
 * stores.
 *
 * **A row only moves within its own list.** The lists are: the top level (the
 * two rails and the categories, all ordered against each other), the dishes of
 * one category, and the sub-categories of one category. A row dropped into
 * another branch keeps the parent it had and simply lands at the matching place
 * among its own siblings — which is what makes this total: no drag can produce
 * a menu that could not exist.
 *
 * That is deliberate rather than a limitation. Re-filing a dish or a
 * sub-category is an edit on its own form, where the parent is a select and the
 * name is revalidated against where it is going (.ai/rules/actions-menus.md).
 * A drag that re-parented would be a second mechanism having to repeat that
 * uniqueness rule, and getting it wrong means the expression unique index
 * refuses the write as a 500 rather than as a message.
 *
 * Keys are formatted here as well as parsed here, so the table that renders
 * them and the action that reads them cannot drift apart.
