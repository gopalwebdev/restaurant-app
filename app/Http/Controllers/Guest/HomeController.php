 * what each one looks like, the tiles inside them and where each one goes. This
 * reads that arrangement and hands it over; the guest app draws whatever it is

 *
 * Rows and their tiles come down together — one screen a guest scrolls — and a
 * row whose tiles all lead nowhere is dropped rather than drawn as an empty
