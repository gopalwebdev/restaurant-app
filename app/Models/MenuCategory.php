/**
 * A section of one of a restaurant's menus, at either of its two levels.
 *
 * A top-level category is Starters, Biryani, Desserts. A category with a
 * `parent_id` is a subdivision of one — Biryani → Chicken, Mutton, Vegetable —
 * and both live in this one table.
 *
 * One table rather than two because a dish then points at exactly one category
 * whichever level it sits on, so there is no (category, sub-category) pair to
 * keep consistent and no composite key needed to police one. Moving a
 * subdivision under a different category is a single `parent_id` write, and its
 * dishes follow because they were never pointing at the parent.
 *
 * Two levels and no more. `isTopLevel()` and `isSubCategory()` are the whole of
 * that distinction, and booted() refuses a parent that is itself nested.
 *
 * Categories are ordered by hand rather than alphabetically, because a menu is
 * read in the order the restaurant means it to be read. `position` orders a row
 * among its **siblings** — top-level categories against each other, and the
 * subdivisions of one category against each other.
 *
 * menu_id is carried alongside tenant_id and the pair is a composite foreign
 * key into menus, so a section can never end up under another restaurant's
 * menu; (parent_id, menu_id) is a second composite key into this table, so a
 * subdivision can never end up under a category on a different menu. The name
 * is translated — see HasTranslatedNames.
