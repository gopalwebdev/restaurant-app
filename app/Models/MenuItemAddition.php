 * The price is what the addition adds to the dish, not what the dish becomes,
 * and it is an integer count of the currency's minor unit like every other
 * money column here. Zero is a real price — "no onions" costs nothing and is
 * still worth listing.
 *
 * tenant_id is carried directly as well as through the dish, and the
 * composite foreign key on (menu_item_id, tenant_id) is what stops the two
 * disagreeing. Same shape as menu_items; see .ai/rules/models.md.
