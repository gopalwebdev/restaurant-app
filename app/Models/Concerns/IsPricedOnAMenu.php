/**
 * Something a guest can buy off a menu: a dish, or a combo of them.
 *
 * Both carry the same four things — a price in minor units, an optional higher
 * price shown struck through beside it, an optional GST rate of their own, and
 * a currency that belongs to the restaurant rather than to them. This is where
 * that behaviour lives once, so the two models cannot drift.
 *
 * Using models must have `price_minor_units`, `compare_at_price_minor_units`
 * and `tax_rate_basis_points` columns, and a `tenant_id`.
 *
 * Every reader takes an optional override, and lists should pass one.
 * Resolving the currency or the tax rate per row is a query per row that
 * answers the same thing for every one of them — every dish on a menu shares
 * one restaurant. See .ai/rules/models.md.
