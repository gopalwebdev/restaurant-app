 * A model whose guest-facing text is stored one value per language.

 * {"en": "Starters", "ta": "தொடக்கம்"} and `$model->name` gives back whichever
 * matches the current locale, falling back to English. Using models must
 * declare `public array $translatable`.
 *
 * What this adds is the one thing the package leaves to the application:
 * English is privileged. It is the fallback, it is what the admin forms
 * require, and it is the value every unique index in the schema is built on
 * — so queries that sort or match on a name have to say so, and this is where
 * they say it once.
