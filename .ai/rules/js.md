## Vitest specs live in resources/js/tests, never beside a page
`vp test` (Vitest, configured in the `test` block of vite.config.ts) only collects `resources/js/tests/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`.

Do not co-locate a spec inside `resources/js/pages/` — Inertia resolves every file under that directory as a page component, so `welcome.test.tsx` would register as a page named "welcome.test" and get bundled into the production build.

`resources/js/tests/setup.ts` stubs Inertia's `<Head>`, which otherwise throws because its head manager only exists after createInertiaApp has run.
