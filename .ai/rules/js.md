## Vitest specs live in resources/js/tests, never beside a page
`vp test` (Vitest, configured in the `test` block of vite.config.ts) only collects `resources/js/tests/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`.

Do not co-locate a spec inside `resources/js/pages/` — Inertia resolves every file under that directory as a page component, so `welcome.test.tsx` would register as a page named "welcome.test" and get bundled into the production build.

`resources/js/tests/setup.ts` stubs Inertia's `<Head>`, which otherwise throws because its head manager only exists after createInertiaApp has run.

## The customer UI is a phone UI
Guests reach a restaurant on their phone, so every customer-facing React page is designed at phone width and judged there. Lay out for one narrow column, size tap targets for thumbs, and never rely on hover to make something usable. Desktop breakpoints are not the job: reach for sm:/md:/lg: only to stop a page looking stretched on a wider screen, never to build a second layout, and never let a phone carry the cost of one.

Staff tools are the opposite — see the panel rule in .ai/rules/filament.md, which is laptop-and-larger.
