# Resources Tables

## One name column, in whichever language the panel is being worked in
A table shows one column per translated field, not one per language. `TextColumn::make('name')` already renders Spatie's accessor, which answers in the panel's current locale — switching the language in the top bar changes what the column reads. The `name_ta` / `title_ta` / `label_ta` companion columns were removed: they duplicated a column that already answers the question, and cost a column of width on every table.

Searching and sorting still have to name a language, because the column is a JSON document — keep `TranslatedFields::search()` / `::sort()`. Both follow the **panel's** language, like the column does: search looks in that language and in English, with `ilike` because Postgres's `like` is case-sensitive, and sort orders by `coalesce(<that language>, <English>)`, which is exactly the value on screen. They used to work on English only, so a Tamil panel displayed Tamil and could not find it. Uniqueness is the one thing still built on English (the expression indexes), and it is not a display question.

A resource with a translated `$recordTitleAttribute` must also override `getGloballySearchableAttributes()` with `TranslatedFields::searchableAttributes()`. Left alone, the top bar's search matches the column as raw JSON text: a Tamil search misses, because the document stores Tamil as escape sequences, and a search for "en" matches every row. Menus, dishes and home rows all do this.

The panel calls a top-level `menu_categories` row a **category** and a nested one a **sub-category**, never a section. `lang/en/panel.php` is the only place that wording lives; the model, the tables and the routes all say category, parent or menu_category — there is no `sub_category` anywhere in the schema, because both levels are one table.

A price column carries its struck-through "was" price as the column's `description()` rather than taking a column of its own, which would be empty for every row that is not on offer — most of them. The same trick carries a dish's description under its name.
