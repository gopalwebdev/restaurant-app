# Config

## Valkey backs cache, session and queue; Horizon runs the workers
Valkey is Redis wire-compatible, so `CACHE_STORE`, `SESSION_DRIVER` and `QUEUE_CONNECTION` are all `redis` against 127.0.0.1:6379 via phpredis. There is no separate Valkey driver — do not go looking for one.

Queued work needs `php artisan horizon` running; nothing is delivered without it. Supervisor queues are `['mail', 'default']` in that order, and `/horizon` is gated on the super-admin role in HorizonServiceProvider.

phpunit.xml pins tests to array cache/session and the sync queue, so tests never touch Valkey. If tests start behaving as though they share state, check for a stale `bootstrap/cache/config.php` — a cached config silently overrides every phpunit.xml env var. `php artisan optimize:clear` fixes it, and nothing in local development should leave those caches in place.

## Postgres is the only database, tests included
`config/database.php` has one connection, `pgsql`, and it is the default. `phpunit.xml` pins only the connection and a `restaurant_app_testing` database; host, port and user come from `.env`, so the suite runs against the same local server as development. CI runs a `postgres:18` service with the same database name. Create it once locally against Herd's Postgres (`createdb restaurant_app_testing`, or `create database restaurant_app_testing` in psql).

There is no SQLite anywhere — no connection, no `database/database.sqlite`, no driver branching in migrations, no `pdo_sqlite` in CI — so write Postgres: `jsonb`, CHECK constraints, expression and partial indexes, `ilike`. The suite running on the production engine is also what finally catches the Postgres-only failures that used to surface first in production.

## DB_TIMEZONE must be a named zone, never an offset
The application runs in Asia/Kolkata, set from `APP_TIMEZONE` in .env, and the pgsql connection is given the same zone through `DB_TIMEZONE` so `now()` in PHP and `now()` in SQL agree. phpunit.xml pins APP_TIMEZONE too, so tests behave as production does.

The trap: it has to be the named zone, not an offset. Laravel issues `SET TIME ZONE '<value>'`, and Postgres reads a bare `+05:30` with POSIX sign conventions — positive means *west* of Greenwich — so it silently lands on UTC-5:30, eleven hours out, with no error. Verified: `+05:30` gives `00:50:05-05:30` where `Asia/Kolkata` gives `11:50:05+05:30`.

Never hardcode a zone or an offset in code; both come from the environment.

## config/restaurants.php holds only the default role limits
default_max_admins and default_max_staff seed a newly created restaurant's max_admins/max_staff columns (see .ai/rules/app.md's "A restaurant caps its own admins and staff"). They are not read anywhere after a restaurant is created — RestaurantForm's create-form default() reads them, and the migration's column default() does too, but every existing restaurant's actual limit lives on its own row, edited from RestaurantForm. Do not add a runtime read of this config expecting it to reflect an existing restaurant's current limit.
