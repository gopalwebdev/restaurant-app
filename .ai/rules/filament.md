# Filament

## Each panel owns its own Filament namespace; both are served at /admin
Two panels, kept apart on purpose:
- super-admin — root domain, /admin, classes under app/Filament/SuperAdmin/
- admin — restaurant subdomain, /admin, classes under app/Filament/Admin/

They share the path and are told apart by host, which holds for one non-obvious reason. The restaurant panel's sign-in route — and its logout, and its `/admin` tenant redirect — carries **no domain**, because nobody has a tenant before signing in, so it answers on the root domain too. `SuperAdminPanelProvider` is therefore registered **before** `AdminPanelProvider` in `bootstrap/providers.php`, so the product team panel's root-domain routes are matched first. Swap the order and the root domain's `/admin/login` becomes a tenant-less restaurant sign-in. `PanelRoutingTest` pins it. A link to a restaurant's sign-in is built with its subdomain (`Restaurant::adminSignInUrl()`), never with `route('filament.admin.auth.login')`, which has no host of its own.

App\Enums\AdminPanel is the single source of truth for the Filament panel id (`super-admin`, `admin` — route names are built from it, and were kept when the product team moved off `/super-admin`) and for the path; the providers and User::canAccessPanel() all read it. Never hardcode 'admin'/'super-admin' or a panel path anywhere else.

Never put a page, resource or widget where both panels discover it. Shared behaviour goes in an abstract base under app/Filament/Auth/ (see OtpLogin) and each panel registers its own thin subclass.

## Built-in roles and permissions are guarded on the resource, not the policy
A role or permission whose name has an App\Enums case is built-in, because code refers to it by that name. What is withheld is narrow and deliberate:

- a built-in **role**: its permissions are fully editable, its name is not, and it may never be deleted
- a built-in **permission**: read-only, since its name is what `can()` checks
- any permission a role holds, or any role a user holds, may not be deleted until that link is undone

Those guards live in RoleResource/PermissionResource::canDelete() (and `disabled()` on the name field), NOT in the policy, because AppServiceProvider's Gate::before returns true for a super admin before any policy method runs — a policy check would be skipped for exactly the people who can reach these pages. Role and Permission models also throw from updating/deleting hooks as a backstop, which is why neither resource offers a bulk delete.

Both panels run `strictAuthorization()`, so a resource whose policy lacks the method being asked about is refused rather than waved through. tests/Feature/PanelAuthorizationTest.php walks every registered resource and page in both panels and asserts an account holding nothing is refused, so a page added later cannot ship open.

## Panels are for laptops and larger screens, not phones
Both panels are back-office tools — the product team's, and a restaurant admin's — used sitting down at a laptop or a bigger display. "Staff" in this codebase means floor staff on phones; they have no surface right now, and would not be given a panel. Design for that width and do not spend effort making a panel page work on a phone: no phone-first layouts, and no hiding columns below a breakpoint with visibleFrom()/hiddenFrom(), which only costs information when a laptop window is dragged narrow. A table may show every column it needs, and a form may assume the room to use columns().

This is enforced, not just intended: both panels render `resources/views/filament/desktop-only.blade.php` through the `BODY_START` render hook, which covers the panel with a "open this on a laptop" message below 1024px. It is CSS-only and inline, so it is correct on first paint and needs none of the utilities a panel does not ship. It is a door, not a second layout — building a phone layout for a panel is exactly what this rule rules out.

The guest app is the opposite — see .ai/rules/js.md, which is phone-only. A staff surface, when one comes back, is not a panel either: staff are on phones, and this rule is the reason.

Panels are served Filament's own compiled CSS, which carries its fi- classes and no general Tailwind utilities, so any styling of your own needs inline styles or a panel theme rather than utility classes.

## Never bind roles or permissions with Filament's ->relationship()
A `CheckboxList::make('permissions')->relationship(...)` writes the pivot table directly, which bypasses Spatie's `syncRoles()` / `syncPermissions()` and so never calls `forgetCachedPermissions()`. The registrar then answers every `can()` check for the rest of the request from the set that was there before the save.

Use plain `->options()` instead, and hand the ids to an action on the page: SetRolePermissions (roles) or SetUserRoles (users). Both go through Spatie, which flushes the cache. Edit pages fill the field back in `mutateFormDataBeforeFill()`.

This is about **Spatie roles and permissions specifically**, because of that cache — it is not a ban on `->relationship()`. An ordinary `hasMany` has no cache behind it, and `MenuItemForm`'s additions repeater uses `->relationship()` on purpose so a dish and its extras are written in one save.

## Translated fields are one box and one switcher, not a box per language
Guest-facing text is stored one value per language (`.ai/rules/models.md`). Build the inputs with `App\Filament\Schemas\TranslatedFields::text()` / `::optionalText()` / `::textarea()`, and put `TranslatedFields::localeSwitcher()` once at the top of the form.

There is still an input per `App\Enums\Locale` case underneath — that is how every language reaches the save in one go — but only the switched-to one is on screen. A form with a name and a description was four boxes; it is two, and it no longer grows by a box per field per language.

This replaced two-inputs-side-by-side. That arrangement was defended here as "less machinery", and it was, but it doubled the height of every form and left half of each line to a language most restaurants fill in later. Do not go back to it without saying so.

Four things the switcher costs, all handled inside `TranslatedFields` and none of them optional if you add a field type there:

- **The switcher itself is set with `formatStateUsing()`, not `default()`.** A default only applies to a form filled with *nothing*, so every edit form — and every modal handed data, which includes a create modal with one field prefilled — opened with neither language lit. That is not cosmetic: the switcher decides which box is on screen and which value the "required in English" rule reads. Formatting the state normalises whatever the form was opened with, `null` included, to **the language the panel is being worked in** — the top bar's choice, which `SetLocale` puts on every request, Livewire's included, because it is in the `web` group. A panel switched to Tamil opens every form on Tamil; one nobody has switched opens on English. It was English unconditionally for one change, and a Tamil panel had to move the switcher on every record.
- Hidden languages carry `->dehydratedWhenHidden()`. Without it, typing the Tamil and saving would blank the English.
- The "English is required" rule rides on **every** language's input, reading the English value out of the form state. Left only on the English input it would never fire, because that input is hidden at exactly the moment it needs to.
- The uniqueness rule does the same, for the same reason — though only the input for the language on screen runs its query, since every input asks the same question about the English value and the duplicate-query guard would otherwise stop the page. It is built on the English name because the database's expression index is — a rule that skipped while Tamil was on screen would let a duplicate through to fail at the index instead.

Table columns must still go through `TranslatedFields::sort()` / `::search()` — both answer in the panel's language, with English for anything untranslated — and every edit action still needs `->mutateRecordDataUsing(fn (array $data, Model $record) => XForm::fillTranslations($data, $record))` — Spatie hands back one language, and a form editing all of them needs the whole document.

One trap in the uniqueness rule, which cost an afternoon. It ignores the record being edited so a name does not clash with itself, and it used to take that record from the `$record` a schema injects. **A schema is handed whatever record surrounds it**: on a resource or a relation manager that is the row being edited, but an action modal on a page falls back to *that page's* record — a `Menu` — and `whereKeyNot($menu->getKey())` silently excluded the category that happened to share the id, letting a duplicate through to fail at the expression index instead. So `uniqueFallbackValue()` now applies the exclusion only when the record is of the same model as the query, and a form opened from a table of arrays is handed the row explicitly (`MenuCategoryForm::configure($schema, $menuId, $editing)`). The injected parameter is typed `mixed` for the same reason — a custom-data table's record is an `array`, and `?Model` would be a TypeError.

## The panel is worked in a language too, and its labels are methods
Both panels carry a language switcher in the top bar (`resources/views/filament/language-switcher.blade.php`, hung on `USER_MENU_BEFORE`) and both list `SetLocale` in their own middleware stack — a panel does not run the `web` group, so the middleware that reads the language cookie has to be named there as well.

The form posts to the host it was rendered on, because a cross-host post loses the session: the tenant panel uses `preferences.language.update` with the tenant's slug, and the product team's panel uses the root-domain `panel.language.update`. Both hit the same controller.

**Labels must be methods, not static properties.** A `protected static ?string $modelLabel = 'menu'` is evaluated when the class loads, before the request has been served, so it cannot read anything request-scoped. Use `getModelLabel()`, `getPluralModelLabel()` and `getNavigationGroup()` returning `__('panel....')`.

The panel's own labels are English and stay English: `lang/en/panel.php` is the only file, and a `lang/ta/panel.php` was deleted deliberately (`.ai/rules/lang.md`). What the switcher still changes is the **restaurant's** words — a menu or dish name comes out of a translated column and follows the chosen language, so a Tamil-reading manager reads their own menu in Tamil with the panel's labels in English around it. **Roles, permissions, accounts and restaurants** are English for a second reason: code refers to those names.

## Both panels navigate as a SPA, and prefetch on hover
`->spa(hasPrefetching: true)` on both providers, so moving between pages is a Livewire visit with a progress bar across the top rather than a browser load, and hovering a link fetches its page before the click. Links inside a panel carry `wire:navigate.hover`; a form post — the language switcher, for one — is unaffected, and so is anything pointing off the panel's host (Filament compares hosts, so the product team's link into a restaurant's subdomain stays a real browser visit).

Deployment runs `php artisan optimize` and `php artisan filament:optimize` (`composer deploy`), which cache Filament's components and Blade Icons. Never run those locally: a component cache stops new resources and pages being discovered until it is cleared.

## No theming in the panel
A restaurant chooses no colours and no light/dark default. `App\Enums\Appearance` has two cases and lives on the phone. Do not add a theme section back without asking.

The Settings page has four sections — Contact, Trading, Tax and Charges — and no others. Tax holds the GSTIN, the default GST rate every price falls back to, and whether menu prices already include it; Charges holds the service and parcel charges, each as a **switch plus an amount** rather than an amount alone, so a restaurant that levies neither says so rather than setting it to zero. (For the service charge that distinction is the point: the CCPA's 2022 guidelines make it voluntary.)

Every rate and amount is typed the way a person says it — "5" percent, "10" percent, "20" rupees — and stored the way the rest of the application stores its kind: rates in basis points, money in minor units. `Settings::readableCharges()` / `::storableCharges()` are the only place that conversion happens, so the rounding is done once.

## Form fields carry no helper text
A label and a sensible input say what a field is. A paragraph under every one of them turned the dish form into a page and a half of prose to fill in one line of prices, and an admin who fills that form daily reads none of it after the first time.

So: no `helperText()` on a form field, and no `->description()` on a form section. Where a field genuinely needs explaining, the fix is usually a better label, a `placeholder` that shows what happens if it is left empty (see the tax rate, which shows the restaurant's own rate), or a `suffix`/`prefix` that names the unit.

Three things are deliberately **not** covered by this and stay: empty-state headings and descriptions, which is where a restaurant with nothing set up needs telling what the page is for; the `modalDescription()` on a destructive action, because what a delete takes with it cannot be inferred from a button; and validation messages, which explain a refusal that has already happened.

A conditional table `description()` — one shown only while an action is unavailable — was tried on the dishes page to explain how to enable dragging, and taken out again. The rule is not "no permanent prose", it is **no prose**: a control that only appears once a filter is set is discoverable by using the filter, and a sentence saying so is a sentence to read every time you visit the page and do not need it.
