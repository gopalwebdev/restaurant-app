 * The header both phone apps wear.

 * Always carries the two things a visitor can change for themselves — light or
 * dark, and the language — because on a phone there is nowhere else to put
 * them: no sidebar, no settings screen worth the taps.
 *
 * There is deliberately no logo. A restaurant's name is set and its brand
 * colour is already carried by every button and price on the screen; a logo
 * slot would be an empty box on every restaurant that has not uploaded one.
 *
 * Shared between the two apps, which .ai/rules/js.md allows for components —
 * only pages/guest and pages/staff may never import from each other.
