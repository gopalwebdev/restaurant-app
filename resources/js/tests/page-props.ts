 * usePage(), which only exists inside createInertiaApp. setup.ts mocks that to
 * read from here instead.
 *
 * The strings below mirror lang/en/guest.php closely enough for a
 * component test to assert on, but they are not the real ones and are not meant
 * to be: what the apps actually say in each language is pinned by
 * tests/Feature/LocalizationTest.php, against the files themselves.
