{{--
    Light or dark, decided before anything renders.

    It has to be here rather than in an Inertia prop: React runs after the first
    paint, so a prop would show one shade and then visibly correct itself in
    front of the guest. The value is the visitor's own choice, from the
    unencrypted `appearance` cookie — there is no brand colour and no per
    restaurant default. See App\Enums\Appearance.

        // Left on the element for React to read back, so the theme toggle
        // starts in the state the page was actually painted in rather than
        // guessing and then correcting itself.
        document.documentElement.dataset.appearance = appearance;
