{{--
    The mark shown wherever a panel names itself: the sign-in card, and the
    topbar once someone is inside.

    Styles are inline because a panel is served Filament's own compiled CSS,
    which carries its fi- classes and no general utilities to lean on. The
    colours are the panel's own, so each panel brands itself.

    $name overrides the panel's own brandName() — the restaurant panel passes the
    signed-in restaurant's own name once one is known, and falls back to its
    generic name before that. The product team's panel never passes it: it
    has no tenant to name itself after.
