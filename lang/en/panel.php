| Admin Panel

|
| The parts of the restaurant admin panel that follow the language chosen in
| its top bar. Deliberately only the menu and storefront surfaces: those are
| what a restaurant works in daily, and what a Tamil-speaking manager needs to
| read. Roles, permissions and accounts stay in English — they are the product
| team's vocabulary and code refers to them by name.
|
| What a restaurant typed itself — menu, section, dish, addition and tile names
| — is not here. That lives in translated database columns; see
| .ai/rules/models.md.
